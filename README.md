 ## Purpose
To showcase devepoment skillsets in a multitude of prgraming languages.
Displaying projects and also the comprehension of CSS reguarding resposive layout and design elements.

My goal was to really push myself to try new things. Since this was my portfolio that I will potentially be putting infront of a client one day i really wanted it to represent my style and who I am as a web designer and also my new skills as web creator. I am really excited to fine tune the site over the next few weeks to really come out of this bootcamp with a bang and have something increadable to show at the end.
